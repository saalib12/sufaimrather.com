<P> THE CREATOR (ALLAH)
"O" ,MANKIND!FEAR YOUR LORD WHO HAS CREATED YOU FROM ONE SOUL.
AND FROM THAT SOUL CREATED HIS WIFE,AND THEN FROM THEM HE SCATTERED MANY MEN AND WOMEN.
AND FEAR ALLAH THROUGH WHOM YOU DEMAND YOUR MUTUAL RIGHT'S (AND FEAR) THE (RIGHTS OF) THE WOMBS (KINSHIP).
INDEED,ALLAH IS EVER WATCHFUL OVER YOU."<BR>
AN-NISA 4:1. <BR>
"AND WE SAID: 'O ADAM!DWELL YOU AND YOUR WIFE IN THE PARADISE,AND EAT THEREFROM,FREELY AS YOU
PLEASE;AND DO NOT APPROACH THIS TREE LEST YOU BECOME TRANSGRESORS.'BUT THE SATAN MADE THEM SLIP THEREFROM
(THE PARADISE), AND GOT THEM OUT FROM THAT IN WHICH THEY WERE. WE SAID:GET DOWN ALL YOU,YOU ARE ENEMIES OF ONE ANOTHER.
THERE SHALL BE FOR YOU ON EARTH A DWELLING PLACE AND ENJOYMENT FOR A TIME.'ADAM THEN RECEIVED CERTAIN WORDS FROM HIS
LORD AND SO HE ACCEPTED HIS REPENTANTANCE.INDEED,HE IS THE ONE WHO ACCEPTS REPENTANCE,THE MOST MERCIFUL.<BR>
